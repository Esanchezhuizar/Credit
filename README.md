# Credit
Program prompts user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein.

According to Luhn’s algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:

1. Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
2. Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
3. If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!
